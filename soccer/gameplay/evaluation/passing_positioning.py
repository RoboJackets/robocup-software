## Finds the best location with a rectangle to pass the ball into
#
# By default, this is use the half of the field in front of the ball (Or the opponents half)
# The best location is found by combining the pass chance by the
# openness, field position coefficients, and shot chance
#
# Example usage:
# point, score = evaluation.passing.eval_best_receive_point(main.ball().pos)


## Evaluates a single point and returns the overall coefficient for the area
#
# @param kick_point: Point where we are kicking from
# @param ignore_robots: Robots to ignore
# @param min_pass_dist: Minimum distance that we should ever pass
# @param field_weights: A tuple of the 3 difference weights to apply to field position
#               (Centerness, Distance to their goal, Angle off their goal)
# @param weights: A tuple of the 4 different weights to apply to the evaulations overall

# @param recieve_x: X position of the receive point
# @param recieve_y: Y position of the receive point
# @return Returns a score between 0 and 1 on how good of pass would be
