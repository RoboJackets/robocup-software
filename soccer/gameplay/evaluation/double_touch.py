# This module implements our observance of the double-touch rule
#
# From the official rules (as of 2013):
#   "If, after the ball enters play other than due to a forced restart, the kicker touches the ball a second
#    time (without holding the ball) before it has touched another robot:
#      an indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team, the kick to be taken from the place
#      where the infringement occurred (see Law 13)"
#
