## @brief A standardized play that handles actions that an average play needs
# Right now, this is only used to implement a standard way to run or not run
# the play with defense, but any action that a normal play should do can be
# placed here
class StandardPlay(play.Play):

    ##
    # Performs actions that all "Standard Plays" should do on initialization
    # Note: This method is called many times during the duration of a play,
    # Not just on selection

        #defense, then it adds the defense behavior. If the box isn't checked and the
        #play is running defense then it removes the behavior. Also note: it ignores
        #the requirement for goalie if the box is checked.

    ##A private list of situations that are applicable to this play
