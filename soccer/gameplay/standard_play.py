## @brief A standardized play that handles actions that an average play needs
# Right now, this is only used to implement a standard way to run or not run
# the play with defense, but any action that a normal play should do can be
# placed here
class StandardPlay(play.Play):

    ##
    # Performs actions that all "Standard Plays" should do on initialization
    # Note: This method is called many times during the duration of a play,
    # Not just on selection
    def __init__(self, continuous: bool):
        super().__init__(continuous)

    ##A private list of situations that are applicable to this play

    ##
    # Handles activity while the play is active. A play wishing to utilize this
    # method in addition to having an "execute_running" method of its own must call
    # it via super
    def execute_running(self):
        pass

    # Plays that handle the goalie should override this and return true
    @classmethod
    def handles_goalie(cls) -> bool:
        return False

    ##
    # Call to attempt to preempt the play
    # Returns true if the preempt is successful

    # or return float('inf') if it is not
    #
    # The expected interaction is to override this function can call super()
    # to get a baseline score, then to modify that score based on situational
    # factors. If you get a float("inf") back you know that situation analysis
    # is not running and you will need to overwrite that with some other score
