# This handles passing from one bot to another
# Simply run it and set it's receive point, the rest is handled for you
# It starts out by assigning a kicker and a receiver and instructing them to lineup for the pass
# Once they're aligned, the kicker kicks and the receiver adjusts itself based on the ball's movement
# Note: due to mechanical limitations, a kicker often gets stuck trying to adjust its angle while it's just outside of it's
#       aim error threshold.  If this happens, the CoordinatedPass will adjust the receive point slightly
#       because it's easier to move the receiver over a bit than have the kicker adjust its angle.  This solves
#       the problem of having a pass get stuck indefinitely while the kicker sits there not moving.
# TODO: # If an opponent blocks the pass channel, it will wait until it moves - you can cancel it at this point if you wish
# As soon as the kicker kicks, it is no longer and is released by this behavior so other behaviors can be assigned to it
# If the receiver gets the ball, CoordinatedPass transitions to the completed state, otherwise it goes to the failed state
