 * @param timeIntoLap How long since we started moving along the trapezoid
 * @param finalSpeed The speed we'd like to be going at the end of the trapezoid
 * @param distOut The position to be at at the given time
 * @param speedOut The speed to be at at the given time
 * @return true if the trapezoid is valid at the given time, false otherwise
