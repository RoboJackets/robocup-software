The naming convention for the config files is as follows:
[real|sim](Field Location)

The config should be specific to either the real robots or a simulation

The field location allows configs for different scenarios, especially as
carpets change between situations.  For normal testing at 14th street,
use the "ShopField" settings, and for competitions on other fields, make 
a new config to allow for adaptation of parameters.
