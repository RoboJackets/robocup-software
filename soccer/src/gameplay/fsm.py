## @brief generic hierarchial state machine class.
#
# states can have substates.  If the machine is in a state, then it is also implicitly in that state's parent state
# this basically provides for polymorphism/subclassing of state machines
#
# There are three methods corresponding to each state:
# * on_enter_STATE
# * execute_STATE
# * on_exit_STATE
#
# Subclasses of StateMachine can optionally implement them and they will automatically be called at the appropriate times.
