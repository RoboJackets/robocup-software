/**
 * @brief Receives vision packets over UDP and places them in a buffer until
 * they are read.
 *
 * @details When start() is called, a new thread is spawned that listens on a
 * UDP port for packets. If sim = true, it tries both simulator ports until one
 * works. Otherwise, it connects to the port specified in the constructor.
 *
 * Whenever a new packet comes in (encoded as Google Protobuf), it is parsed
 * into an SSL_WrapperPacket and placed onto the circular buffer @_packets.
 * They remain there until they are retrieved with getPackets().
