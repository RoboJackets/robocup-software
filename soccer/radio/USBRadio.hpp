/**
 * @brief Radio IO with real robots
 * 
 * @details This class provides us the ability to communicate with real robots using our own radio protocol.
 * The radio sends one large packet to all of the robots at once that contains the data in each
 * robot's radioTx packet.  Note that it isn't sent in protobuf format though, it's sent straight-up
 * data to avoid the overhead of protobuf.  Robots respond individually in order of their shell
 * numbers in a set time slot.  The bot with the lowest shell number replies in the first time slot,
 * and so on.  This ensures that robots don't jam each other's communication.
