/**
 * @brief Radio IO with real robots
 *
 * @details This class provides us the ability to communicate with real robots
 *     using our own radio protocol. The radio sends one large packet to all of
 *     the robots at once that contains the data in each robot's radioTx packet.
 *     Note that it isn't sent in protobuf format though, it's sent straight-up
 *     data to avoid the overhead of protobuf.  Robots respond individually in
 *     order of their shell numbers in a set time slot.  The bot with the lowest
 *     shell number replies in the first time slot, and so on.  This ensures
 *     that robots don't jam each other's communication.
