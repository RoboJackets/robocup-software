# Here are some useful environment variables for setting up a consistent ROS environment 
# some information on this can be found here: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Configuring-ROS2-Environment.html 
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=19 # this is a random number, it's just important to keep it consistent across shells 
export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1 # for our stack specifically, this is quite helpful.
