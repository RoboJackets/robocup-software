LEDs, as seen from back of robot:
   LR RR
   LY RY
   LG RG

LR: Charger
	Solid = Charged
	1 flash = Charging
	2 flashes = Charger failure (check kicker power and signal cables)
	3 flashes = ADC failure (check kicker signal cable)
LY: Ball sensor
	Solid = Ball present
	Off = Ball not present
	1 flash = Dazzled (probably need to change thresholds)
	2 flashes = Detector failure
	3 flashes = LED failure
LG: Power.  Depends on motor power (fused), 3.3V, and 5V.

RR: No radio data
RY: Radio TX (reverse)
RG: Radio RX (forward)

DIP switches:
DP1: On=2008 base, Off=2011 base
DP2: On=Disable all motors (for electronics debugging), Off=Normal operation
DP3: On=Reload SAM-BA bootloader, Off=Normal operation
	Set DP3 ON and power on.  Wait 10s.  Set DP3 OFF and power cycle.
	Use "make robot-prog-samba" to reload firmware.
DP4: On=Secondary radio channel, Off=Primary radio channel
