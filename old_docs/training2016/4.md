# Questions about Plays?

-   We're going to slow down a bit after last meeting
    -   We're going to catch up everyone who's behind, and give you a chance to work on something real if you're ahead!
    -   **Plays are not the only area in RoboCup**
    -   They are a very high impact thing to cover though.
-   Topics Covered:
    -   Subbehaviors
    -   Role Requirements
    -   Creating Plays


## Additional Information

-   See the previous slide deck and docs for more information, they should be a pretty comprehensive overview of our play system.


# Solution to Binary Clock


## Solution Links

-   [Binary Clock Soltuion File](https://github.com/RoboJackets/robocup-software/blob/720645581718e52bc174275843fd7d114edf0543/soccer/gameplay/plays/training/binary_clock.py)


# Misc Plays Information


## Do we have any Subbehaviors?

```python
  # Returns True if we have any subbehaivors
  self.has_subbehaviors()
```


## Get all Subbehaviors

```python
  # Returns an array of all subbehaviors
  self.all_subbehaviors()
```


## Is a Subbehaivor Done?

-   Done = our completed or failed states

```python
  self.subbehavior_with_name('mybehavior').is_done_running()
```

# CoordinatedPass Overview

-   Coordinated Pass is a complicated tactic with a lot of different features
-   It is used everywhere, and it isn't terribly complicated

## Let's Look at Code!

-   [Coordinated Pass](https://github.com/RoboJackets/robocup-software/blob/720645581718e52bc174275843fd7d114edf0543/soccer/gameplay/tactics/coordinated_pass.py)


## Overview

-   We went through everything in coordinated pass, which is located [here](https://github.com/RoboJackets/robocup-software/blob/master/soccer/gameplay/tactics/coordinated_pass.py).
-   Using what we learnt in previous sections, this should be fairly self explanitory.
-   For a high level overview, check out the [coordinated pass](https://robojackets.github.io/robocup-software/classgameplay_1_1tactics_1_1coordinated__pass_1_1_coordinated_pass.html) docs page.


# Wrapping Up


## Play Ideas?

-   Offense, Defense, Etc.
-   Great Place for Beginners to Start
-   (side note: Anyone can begin contributing now if you wish)
    -   We `<3` contributions!
    -   Recommend starting with intro issues, then moving on to beginner.


## Future Meeting Possibilities

-   *Joint Meeting with Electrical, Intro To Firmware*
-   *RRT Path Planning in RoboCup (Maybe a bit of Motion Control)*
-   Soccer C++ Internals
-   QT Tutorial (develop soccer's UI!)
-   Contribution Quickstart Meeting
    -   Submitting a PR
    -   Some Git
    -   Build Systems/CI?
-   What do you guys want to learn?


## Assignment

-   Create a Triangle Pass Play
-   Round up 3 Robots in a Triangle, and pass between them.
-   Starter code is in `soccer/gameplay/plays/skel/binary_clock.py` (same as last time).
-   Move it to `soccer/gameplay/plays/training/triangle_pass.py` to begin.


## Tips

1.  Use Move Skills to move your robots to the triangle initially
2.  Use the CoordinatedPass Tactic to pass between, setting receive points as sides of the triangle
3.  At a bare minimum, I would make setup and passing states. You may want to have a state for every side of the triangle (or not).
