Physical units for 2011 robots:
	Times are given in control cycles (5ms/cycle).
	1440*4.5 = 6480 ticks/rev
	Distances are given in encoder ticks.
		0.026*2*pi m/rev / (1440*4.5 ticks/rev) = 0.026*2*pi/(1440*4.5) m/tick
	Wheel angular distance:
		(2*pi rad/rev) / (1440*4.5 ticks/rev) = pi/3240 rad/tick
	Robot angular distance:
		pi/3240 rad/tick * 0.026 / 0.0812 = pi*.026/(.0812*3240) robot-rad/tick
		= 203/776000 rad/tick

Forward (base station to robot):

Byte 0: Sequence number
	Bits 7-3: Reserved
	Bits 2-0: Sequence number
Bytes 1+: Robot command slots, 6 bytes each
	Body velocities are given as 10-bit 2's-complement numbers.
	Not all combinations of velocities that can be transmitted can be achieved.
	The host is responsible for only sending achievable commands.
	Other commands will be executed incorrectly.
