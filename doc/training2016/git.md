# `git`

> The Stupid Content Tracker

-   `git` is *NOT* GitHub.
-   GitHub is 'server git'


## Why `git` over another VCS?

-   Branching and Merging
-   ***FAST***
-   Powerful, and Flexible
-   Free (as in freedom, and as in beer)


## Why `git` over another client?

-   `git` is the 1st party front-end
-   `git` is the way it was designed to be experienced.
-   Learning `git` is the easiest way to understand what's going on.
-   `git` gives you ultimate, uninhibited access to your repository.


## `git` Vocabulary

| Name       | Definition                           |
|---------- |------------------------------------ |
| commit     | version                              |
| repository | collection of files to track         |
| branch     | a quick copy of your code to work on |
| remote     | any other git repository             |
| SHA/Hash   | Turns code into a random string      |


# Basic `git` Commands

-   Follow along on your own computer!


## Setting Up Git

```shell
# Let's git attribute your changes to you!
git config --global user.name "Jay Kamat"
git config --global user.email "yourname@example.com"
```


## Creating a `git` Repo

```shell
# Create a folder named 'repo'
mkdir repo
# Move inside 'repo'
cd repo
# Create a git repository where we are
# (created inside the repo folder)

git init
# > Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/repo/.git/
git status
# > On branch master
# > Initial commit
# > nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

# Use cd .. to move up a directory
```


## Adding *Content*

```shell
# Create a file called file.txt with some text in it.
# Example:
echo "this is a line to be stored into git" > file.txt
git status
# > Untracked files:
# >   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
# >     file.txt
git add file.txt
# > Changes to be committed:
# >   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
# >         new file:   file.txt

# This message should reflect the change. We'll come back to this.
git commit -m "Added a small amount of content"
```


## Staging Area

## Viewing History

-   `git` versions are 'hashes'
    -   Something like: `cbbd8d9a5e...`
    -   You don't need the full hash to refer to a commit
        -   Only use ~6 chars from the front.

```shell
# Show the latest commit
git show

# Show all commits (use q to quit)
git log
```


## `git` History

-   Every git version is linked to it's previous versions:
-   `v1 <- v2 <- v3 <- v4`
-   A version can have multiple previous versions
    -   Let's demonstrate this in&#x2026;


# `git` Branching

-   We'll discuss what we're doing in a bit
-   Let's create a new feature, but we know it's going to be buggy
    -   Let's create it in an isolated environment, a branch!


## Create a feature branch

```shell
# Create a myfeature branch
git branch myfeature
# Move to myfeature branch
git checkout myfeature

# Let's find out where we are
git status
# > On branch myfeature
# > nothing to commit, working tree clean
```


## Add a new 'feature'

```shell
echo "My new feature!" >> file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m 'My new feature is very cool, but buggy!'
```


## There's a bug in the released version!

-   Let's patch the version everyone is on, the master release!

```shell
# Switch back to the master branch
git checkout master
git status
# Look at the contents of file.txt at this point!

echo "My critical bugfix!" >> file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Critical bugfix number 1!"
```


## What just happened?

-   We first created our test file, which is our 'release version'
-   Then we created a feature branch, and made some 'buggy changes'
-   We then realized we need to fix a bug in the 'release version'
    -   We switched back to release, and 'fixed the bug'


## Let's take a closer look

```shell
# A much nicer git log that will visualize our history
git log --oneline --graph --all

git show <commit hash>
```


## Merging

-   Brings divergent branches together
-   Let's release our feature by putting it into the master branch

```shell
# We want to merge INTO master
git checkout master

# Merge myfeature into master
git merge myfeature
# > Auto-merging file.txt
# > CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
# > Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

# That's not good!
git status
# Edit file.txt to remove >>> <<< and ===
git add file.txt
git commit # Just save whatever pops up
git status
```


# `git` Remotes

-   How do we share our code with others?
-   Branching is great for me, but what if I want to let my friends work on a branch?


## Let's Play With Remotes

```shell
# let's start in a common state
git checkout master

# let's make a copy for 'our friend to have'
cd ..
# Clone from the repo folder to the repo2 folder
git clone repo/ repo2/
cd repo2
git status
# > On branch master
# > Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
# > nothing to commit, working tree clean
git log --oneline --abbrev --graph --all
# *   8f12721 Merge branch 'myfeature'
# |\
# | * 2716a3b Add a new feature
# * | 625aaf5 Critical bugfix
# |/
# * cbbd8d9 one small change
```


## Let's Make a Change On 'our computer'

```shell
# Move into 'our repo'
cd ../repo
git status

# Edit file.txt with our changes
echo "A change I made on my computer" >> file.txt

git add file.txt
git commit -m 'Added files from my computer.'
```


## Let's Give This Change To Our Friend

```shell
# Pull new changes from repo's master into repo2's master
cd ../repo2
git pull ../repo master
# > From ../repo
# >  * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
# > Updating 8f12721..2b05fa9
# > Fast-forward
# >  file.txt | 1 +
# >  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```


## Shortcuts to make remotes faster

```shell
# Add a shortcut to interact with ../repo2
cd ../repo
git remote add repo2 ../repo2
# same as git pull ../repo2 master
git pull repo2 master
# > From ../repo2
# >  * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
# > Already up-to-date.

# List existing remotes
git remote -v
# > repo2       ../repo2 (fetch)
# > repo2       ../repo2 (push)

# man git-remote for more options, like
# git remote set-url repo2 ../repo2
# git remote rm repo2
# git remote show repo2
```


## A note about `git fetch`

-   `git fetch` updates what we see in a remote without changing our files.
-   `git pull` updates our files with changes
-   `git fetch` stores those changes made without touching our state.


# `git` refs

-   `git` has a suite of commands for interacting with history.
    -   To use them, you will need to understand refs
-   A ref is anything that identifies a commit&#x2026;


## Examples of Refs

1.  A Commit Hash (eg: `cbbd8d9a5e1c64f84`)
    -   You can shorten with the first few chars
2.  Special: `HEAD`
    -   A Ref to the commit your repository is currently on
3.  Branch Names
    -   `master`, `myfeature`
4.  Remotes
    -   <remote>/<branch>
    -   `repo2/master`, `origin/master`
5.  Tags
    -   Aliases you can give to commits


## Ref Modifiers

-   Using `HEAD` as an example.
-   `HEAD~`; One commit before `HEAD`
-   `HEAD~~`; Two commits before `HEAD`
-   `HEAD~3`; Three commits before `HEAD`
-   `HEAD^<N>`; Choose the <Nth> parent if we're on a merge.


## Using Refs

```shell
# Show's the current commit, same as git show
git show HEAD

# Shows the commit that's one old
git show HEAD~

# Shows the commit thats two commits older than repo2's master
git show repo2/master~~
```


## Quickly See Files in a Ref

```shell
git checkout <ref>

# Does nothing, HEAD is our current ref
git checkout HEAD

# See the commit before head
git checkout HEAD~
# Warning about detached HEAD

# checkout to 2 commits before the remote's master branch.
git checkout repo2/master~~

# We also use checkout to switch branches (we can edit safely now)
git checkout master
```


## Change Where a Branch 'Points To'

```shell
# Git reset has many uses
# Run git status yourself!

# Move our branch to the previous commit, but don't change our files.
# Any diff is staged
git reset --soft HEAD~
# Go back to where we were
git pull repo2 master

# Move our branch to the previous commit, and change our files
# No diff is present (since we change files)
git reset --hard HEAD~
git pull repo2 master

# Like git reset --soft, but don't stage our files either.
git reset --mixed HEAD~
git pull repo2 master
# Complaint about unstaged files

# HEAD is the default if no ref is supplied
# This resets our files to head, trashing our 'unstaged work'
git reset --hard
git pull repo2 master
```


## Find the Diff Between Two Commits

```shell
# Finds the difference between one commit ago and the current commit
git diff HEAD~ HEAD

# Finds the difference between myfeature and master
git diff myfeature master

# Show unstaged changes
git diff

# Show only staged changes
git diff --staged
```


# Neat Tricks


## Quickly Make a Branch

```shell
git checkout -b mynewbranch

# Same as
git branch mynewbranch
git checkout mynewbranch
```


## Let Git Remember Your Remotes

```shell
git checkout master

# Right now you will need to always do
git push repo2 master

# If you run:
git push -u repo2 master
# Once, you can do
git push

# from now on, git will remember the remote and branch
# that you've paired with your local branch!
# See the push.default config option for more info
```


## Git Aliases

```shell
git config --global alias.s "status"

git s
# is now the same as
git status
```


## Tagging

```shell
git tag myrelease

# now you can do
git checkout myrelease
git reset --hard myrelease
git diff myrelease

# where myrelease refrences the commit you were on.
# Use git push --tags to push your tags as well.
# Tags give a name to A SPECIFIC COMMIT, not to a branch.
```


## `git clean`

-   Use `git clean -f` to remove all *unstaged* files from your repo.
    -   THIS WILL REMOVE FILES ON YOUR FILESYSTEM.


# We Only Scratched The Surface

-   `git rebase`
-   `git revert`
-   `git submodule`
-   `git subtree`
-   `git reflog`
-   `git blame`
-   `git stash`
-   `git grep`
-   `git cherry-pick`
-   `git bisect`
-   `git apply`
-   `git merge-base`
-   `git archive`
-   `git am`

# BONUS: GitHub


## GitHub is just another remote!

```shell
git clone <repo url>

# Git will automatically add a remote for you called 'origin'
git remote -v

git pull origin master
git push origin master
git show origin/master
```


## Pull Request

-   A PR is a request for a maintainer to pull code into a repo you don't have access to
-   First fork the repo (this is a clone from a github repo to a github repo you have write access to)
-   Then clone your fork (you will now be able to commit/push to this fork)
-   Submit a PR from your fork into the target repo
-   Once accepted, the maintainer pulls code from your github fork to the main github repo.


## (Advanced) Pull Requests

-   When you make a PR, you can specify some advanced options, such as where you want the maintainer to pull to
-   For example, you might want to have your code pulled into a feature branch, instead of master
-   The '`base`' is the branch you want to merge into (usually master)


## Example

# BONUS: Commit Messages


## `git` commit

```shell
# What we were using before
git commit -m "Fix memory leak when spacebar was held"

# How do I add more information, like the cause of the leak?
git commit
# This will launch an editor (you can change this with the $EDITOR variable)
# Add your commit message, save, and quit the editor
```


## Commit Message Conventions

![img](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git_commit.png)


## Commit Message Conventions

1.  Separate body and subject with a blank line
2.  Subject line should not be more than 50 chars
3.  Capitalize the subject line
4.  No period at the end of the subject line
5.  Use 'imperative' Language in subject
    -   Good: `Fix memory leak`
    -   Bad: `Fixed memory leak`
6.  Wrap the body at 72 chars
7.  Use the body to explain what/why vs how


## Commit Message Conventions

-   Following these guides help maintainers to find where things went wrong and why
-   It makes the output of `git log --oneline` pretty!
-   Good integration with all git tools
-   Makes your repo look professional
