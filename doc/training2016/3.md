# Skills, Tactics, Plays - 2 {#t20163}

# Questions about Plays?

-   Last meeting was pretty dense
    -   We *NEED* to have 1 on 1 time with each of you, so it is *your* responsibility to waive us over if you're stuck!
-   Topics Covered:
    -   Python
    -   State Machines
    -   Play/Skill/Tactic Structure
-   And today, we're going into&#x2026;

## Additional Information

-   See the previous slide deck and docs for more information, they should be a pretty comprehensive overview of our play system.

# Subbehaviors!

-   A Behavior is a generic name for any skill, play, or tactic.
-   Last meeting we learned about Plays/Skills/Tactics
    -   How do we put them together?
-   Subbehaviors allow you to reuse our behaviors in many plays.
    -   Example: We have *one* move play, used by kicker tactics, passing tactics, goalie, etc.

## Examples of Subbehaviors

-   Offense Play contains Passing Tactics, and Move Skills
-   Passing Tactic Contains Move and Kick Skills

## *Behavior* Tree!

```text
Basic122::running
    Mark::running[robot=4]
	move(0.767296, 6.51286)
	endVelocity(0, 0)
	face(0.160718, 9.15305)
    PivotKick::capturing
	Capture::course_approach[robot=2]
	    face(0.160718, 9.15305)
	    avoidBall(-1)
	    move(0.176939, 9.114)
	    endVelocity(0, 0)
    Mark::running[robot=1]
	move(-0.829012, 6.03814)
	endVelocity(0, 0)
	face(0.160718, 9.15305)
```

### Details

-   Here we have a tree of all the behaviors running
-   We have a basic122 play running
-   It is running 2 Marks, and a PivotKick in this frame
-   The marks are directly running robot commands, like move, and face.
-   The PivotKick is running a capture skill, which is running robot commands, like face, move, etc.

## *Behavior* Tree! (cont.)

```text
Basic122::running
    Defense::defending
	SubmissiveDefender::marking
	    Move::completed[robot=5]
		face(0.160718, 9.15305)
	SubmissiveDefender::marking
	    Move::completed[robot=3]
		face(0.160718, 9.15305)
	SubmissiveGoalie::block
	    Move::running[robot=0]
		face(0.160718, 9.15305)
		move(0.290916, 0.14)
		endVelocity(0, 0)
```

### Details

-   Pretty much same thing here
-   We've got a Defense tactic running, with SubmissiveDefender and Goalie Skills
-   These skills actually run robot commands.

# How do I use subbehaviors?

## Adding Subbehaviors

```python
self.add_subbehavior(skill_object,
		     "Name of Subbehavior",
		     required=False or True
		     priority=10) # A lower number is higher priority
```

### Details

-   For more docs on this entire section see [this link.](https://robojackets.github.io/robocup-software/classgameplay_1_1single__robot__composite__behavior_1_1_single_robot_composite_behavior.html)
-   These subbehaviors show up in the behavior tree when you run your program.
-   This can be extremely useful when debugging state transitions or subbehavior assignments.

## Removing Subbehaviors

```python
self.remove_subbehavior('string name')

self.remove_all_subbehaviors()
```

## Getting Subbehavior Plays

```python
a_subbheavior = self.subbehavior_with_name('string name')
```

# Real Examples

## CoordinatedPass Tactic

```python
def on_enter_running(self):
    receiver = skills.pass_receive.PassReceive()
    receiver.receive_point = self.receive_point
    self.add_subbehavior(receiver,
			 'receiver',
			 required=self.receiver_required)

def on_exit_running(self):
    self.remove_subbehavior('receiver')
```

## Line Up Tactic

-   First State Machine is set up, then:

```python
# Triggered whenever the line changes
self.remove_all_subbehaviors()
for i in range(6):
    pt = self._line.get_pt(0) + (self.diff * float(i))
    self.add_subbehavior(
	skills.move.Move(pt),
	name="robot" + str(i),
	required=False,
	priority=6 - i)
```

```python
def execute_running(self):
    for i in range(6):
	pt = self._line.get_pt(0) + (self.diff * float(i))
	self.subbehavior_with_name("robot" + str(i)).pos = pt
```

# RoboCup Pro Tip

-   Find some code doing something like what you want
-   Tweak it until it works
-   It's less effective than working everything out, but it's great for beginners!

# How do I get MY Robot?!?

## Dynamic Assignment

-   Our role assignment system picks the best robot for the task
-   You define your constraints, and we'll give you a robot if we can!
-   It's also some black magic&#x2026;

## But I want Robot X!

-   Override Role Requirements to add your constraints!
-   This next section is Extra Credit&#x2026;
    -   And it's a massive oversimplification
    -   See `role_assignment.py` for more information.

### Get the closest robot

```python
# From Move
def role_requirements(self):
    reqs = super().role_requirements()
    # Destination Shape is used for distances to points or segments
    reqs.destination_shape = self.pos
    return reqs
```

### Get the robot with all the hardware

```python
def role_requirements(self):
    reqs = super().role_requirements()
    reqs.require_kicking = True
    # try to be near the ball
    if main.ball().valid:
	reqs.destination_shape = main.ball().pos
    return reqs
```

### I really, really, want MY Robot!

```python
# From Goalie
def role_requirements(self):
    reqs = super().role_requirements()

    # This iteration is needed if we have
    # subbehaviors we want to have applied as well.
    for req in role_assignment \
	.iterate_role_requirements_tree_leaves(reqs):

	req.required_shell_id \
	    = self.shell_id if self.shell_id != None else -1
    return reqs
```

# Assignment

-   Create a binary clock play
-   Display the current minute in binary on the field
    -   Use a robot to represent a 1, and lack of a robot to represent a 0
-   Starter code is in `soccer/gameplay/plays/skel/binary_clock.py`.
-   Move it to `soccer/gameplay/plays/training` to begin.

## Tips

```python
import time
mins =  time.localtime().tm_min
binary = format(mins, '06b')
print(binary)
# Index with binary[0-6]
# THIS INDEX IS A CHARACTER VALUE, NOT AN INT
# USE == '1', not == 1
```
