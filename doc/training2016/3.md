# Skills, Tactics, Plays - 2 {#t20163}


# Questions about Plays?

-   Last meeting was pretty dense
    -   We *NEED* to have 1 on 1 time with each of you, so it is *your* responsibility to wave us over if you're stuck!
-   Topics Covered:
    -   Python
    -   State Machines
    -   Play/Skill/Tactic Structure
-   And today, we're going into&#x2026;


## Additional Information

-   See the previous slide deck and docs for more information, they should be a pretty comprehensive overview of our play system.


# Subbehaviors!

-   A Behavior is a generic name for any skill, play, or tactic.
-   Last meeting we learned about Plays/Skills/Tactics
    -   How do we put them together?
-   Subbehaviors allow you to reuse our behaviors in many plays.
    -   Example: We have *one* move play, used by kicker tactics, passing tactics, goalie, etc.


## Examples of Subbehaviors

-   Offense Play contains Passing Tactics, and Move Skills
-   Passing Tactic Contains Move and Kick Skills


## *Behavior* Tree!

```text
Basic122::running
    Mark::running[robot=4]
        move(0.767296, 6.51286)
        endVelocity(0, 0)
        face(0.160718, 9.15305)
    PivotKick::capturing
        Capture::course_approach[robot=2]
            face(0.160718, 9.15305)
            avoidBall(-1)
            move(0.176939, 9.114)
            endVelocity(0, 0)
    Mark::running[robot=1]
        move(-0.829012, 6.03814)
        endVelocity(0, 0)
        face(0.160718, 9.15305)
```


### Details

-   Here we have a tree of all the behaviors running
-   We have a basic122 play running
-   It is running 2 Marks, and a PivotKick in this frame
-   The marks are directly running robot commands, like move, and face.
-   The PivotKick is running a capture skill, which is running robot commands, like face, move, etc.


## *Behavior* Tree! (cont.)

Basic122::running
    Defense::defending
        SubmissiveDefender::marking
            Move::completed[robot=5]
                face(0.160718, 9.15305)
        SubmissiveDefender::marking
            Move::completed[robot=3]
                face(0.160718, 9.15305)
        SubmissiveGoalie::block
            Move::running[robot=0]
                face(0.160718, 9.15305)
                move(0.290916, 0.14)
                endVelocity(0, 0)
```


### Details

-   Pretty much same thing here
-   We've got a Defense tactic running, with SubmissiveDefender and Goalie Skills
-   These skills actually run robot commands.


# How do I use subbehaviors?


## Adding Subbehaviors

```python
  self.add_subbehavior(skill_object,
                       "Name of Subbehavior",
                       required=False or True
                       priority=10) # A higher number is higher priority
```


### Details

-   For more docs on this entire section see [this link.](https://robojackets.github.io/robocup-software/classgameplay_1_1single__robot__composite__behavior_1_1_single_robot_composite_behavior.html)
-   These subbehaviors show up in the behavior tree when you run your program.
-   This can be extremely useful when debugging state transitions or subbehavior assignments.


## Removing Subbehaviors

```python
self.remove_subbehavior('string name')

self.remove_all_subbehaviors()
```


## Getting Subbehavior Plays

```python
a_subbheavior = self.subbehavior_with_name('string name')
```


# Real Examples


## CoordinatedPass Tactic

```python
  def on_enter_running(self):
      receiver = skills.pass_receive.PassReceive()
      receiver.receive_point = self.receive_point
      self.add_subbehavior(receiver,
                           'receiver',
                           required=self.receiver_required)

  def on_exit_running(self):
      self.remove_subbehavior('receiver')
```


## Line Up Tactic

-   First State Machine is set up, then:

```python
  # Triggered whenever the line changes
  self.remove_all_subbehaviors()
  for i in range(6):
      pt = self._line.get_pt(0) + (self.diff * float(i))
      self.add_subbehavior(
          skills.move.Move(pt),
          name="robot" + str(i),
          required=False,
          priority=6 - i)
```

```python
  def execute_running(self):
      for i in range(6):
          pt = self._line.get_pt(0) + (self.diff * float(i))
          self.subbehavior_with_name("robot" + str(i)).pos = pt
```


# RoboCup Pro Tip

-   Find some code doing something like what you want
-   Tweak it until it works
-   It's less effective than working everything out, but it's great for beginners!


# How do I get MY Robot?!?


## Dynamic Assignment

-   Our role assignment system picks the best robot for the task
-   You define your constraints, and we'll give you a robot if we can!
-   It's also some black magic&#x2026;


## But I want Robot X!

-   Override Role Requirements to add your constraints!
-   This next section is Extra Credit&#x2026;
    -   And it's a massive oversimplification
    -   See `role_assignment.py` for more information.


### Get the closest robot

```python
  # From Move
  def role_requirements(self):
      reqs = super().role_requirements()
      # Destination Shape is used for distances to points or segments
      reqs.destination_shape = self.pos
      return reqs
```


### Get the robot with all the hardware

```python
  def role_requirements(self):
      reqs = super().role_requirements()
      reqs.require_kicking = True
      # try to be near the ball
      if main.ball().valid:
          reqs.destination_shape = main.ball().pos
      return reqs
```


### I really, really, want MY Robot!

```python
  # From Goalie
  def role_requirements(self):
      reqs = super().role_requirements()

      # This iteration is needed if we have
      # subbehaviors we want to have applied as well.
      for req in role_assignment \
          .iterate_role_requirements_tree_leaves(reqs):

          req.required_shell_id \
              = self.shell_id if self.shell_id != None else -1
      return reqs
```


# Assignment

-   Create a binary clock play
-   Display the current minute in binary on the field
    -   Use a robot to represent a 1, and lack of a robot to represent a 0
-   Starter code is in `soccer/gameplay/plays/skel/binary_clock.py`.
-   Move it to `soccer/gameplay/plays/training` to begin.


## Tips

```python
import time
mins =  time.localtime().tm_min
binary = format(mins, '06b')
print(binary)
# Index with binary[0-6]
# THIS INDEX IS A CHARACTER VALUE, NOT AN INT
# USE == '1', not == 1
```
