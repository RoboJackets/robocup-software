AT-Tiny / Kicker Board
======================
This folder holds the driver files to allow in system programming (ISP) of the AT-Tiny 84a chip on the kicker board.
* AVR910.h and AVR910.cpp provide ISP support. They are available [here](https://developer.mbed.org/users/aberk/code/mbedAvrProgrammer/)
* KickerBoard.h and KickerBoard.cpp use AVR910 to actually perform the programming.
