Forward command packet:

00  Sequence and reverse ID
    Bits 7-4: Sequence number (for packet loss measurements)
    Bits 3-0: Board ID of robot to send a reverse packet immediately after this forward packet.

For each of five robots:
    +0  Wheel 0 speed
    +1  Wheel 1 speed
    +2  Wheel 2 speed
    +3  Wheel 3 speed
    +4  Dribble/ID
        Bits 7-4: Dribble strength
        Bits 3-0: Board ID of this robot
	+5  Kick strength
    
    Each wheel speed is a signed 8-bit integer on the range [-127, 127].
    Positive speeds produce clockwise rotation.

    To leave a slot unused, fill it with a stop command (all zeros) for an unused robot ID.
