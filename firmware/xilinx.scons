# This script tries to find the Xilinx tools in likely places and
# creates an environment with the path set to use the highest
# available version.
#
# This does not use Xilinx's settings*.sh because it does very little
# good except for the path to binaries and the license file,
# and sometimes system libraries are shipped from Xilinx that are
# incompatible with programs on your system.
#
# If you upgrade the Xilinx tools and get an error saying that
# xflow is not found in the old directory, then you must run
# scons with --implicit-deps-changed to get rid of the out-of-date
# implicit dependency on the xflow binary.
# To make things faster, we tell scons (in the top-level SConstruct)
# to cache such dependencies, but once in a while this is a problem.
