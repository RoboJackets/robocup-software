00-04   Motor 1-5
    Write bits:
        7      : Direction: 0=CW, 1=CCW
        6-0    : Speed (0-127)
    Reads return the hall-effect encoder count for each motor.

08      Motor faults
    Bits 7-5 R : Reserved
           4 R : Motor 5 fault
           3 R : Motor 4 fault
           2 R : Motor 3 fault
           1 R : Motor 2 fault
           0 R : Motor 1 fault
    
    A fault is latched until a one is written into the corresponding bit.

10      Radio SPI data

11      Interrupts
    Bits 7-2 R : Reserved, always zero
           1 R : Radio GDO2
           0 R : Radio GDO0
    
    A bit reads high if a positive edge has been detected.
    Writing a one to a bit resets it.  Writing zero has no effect.

12      Radio configuration
    Bits 7-4 R : Reserved, always zero
           3 R : SPI idle
           2 R : GDO2
           1 R : GDO0
           0 RW: Radio select (active high)

13      Switches
    1=on, 0=off.
    Bits 7-5 R : Reserved, always zero
           4 R : Button
         3-0 R : Switch status

20      Kicker
    Bits 7-0  W: Pulse duration
    Generates a kick pulse with every write
        0=about 100us
        255=about 6ms

21      Kicker status and control
    Bits 7-6 R : Reserved
           5 RW: Select output: 1=chip, 0=kick
           4 R : Charge disabled by button
           3 RW: Charge enable
           2 R : Charge active
           1 R : Lockout (time after kick before kicker can be recharged)
           0 R : Charge done

30	Capture encoder counts (write)
    Any write to this address causes the current encoder counts to be latched.
    They may then be read from registers 0-3.

30	Encoder 1 low (read)
31	Encoder 1 high (read)
32	Encoder 2 low (read)
33	Encoder 2 high (read)
34	Encoder 3 low (read)
35	Encoder 3 high (read)
36	Encoder 4 low (read)
37	Encoder 4 high (read)

FE      Test register (reserved address)
    Any unused or write-only address, including this one, reads 0xc9.
    Writes to read-only or unused addresses have no effect.

FF      Test register
    Contains the value 0xa5 after configuration.
    Reads the last value written to this address.
